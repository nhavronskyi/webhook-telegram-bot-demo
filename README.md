  <p>You need to set this link to the telegram bot as a webhook</p>
  
  ```HTTP
  GET https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_token>/setWebhook?url=<copied_link>
  ```
  
  Then you should receive an answer like:
  
  ```JSON
  {
    "ok": true,
    "result": true,
    "description": "Webhook was set"
  }
  ```
  
  You can check if the link chains with your bot:
  
  ```HTTP
  GET https://api.telegram.org/bot<your_token>/getWebhookInfo
  ```

  Now you can put your webhook link to your application properties, and run your application.
